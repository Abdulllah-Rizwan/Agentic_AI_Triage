# DECISIONS.md — Agentic AI Triage Architecture Decision Log

This file records every significant decision made during development — what was chosen, what was rejected, and why. Update this file whenever something deviates from CLAUDE.md. Claude Code reads this to avoid re-suggesting things that have already been tried and rejected.

**How to add an entry:** Copy the template at the bottom, fill it in, and add it under the relevant section. Date format: YYYY-MM-DD.

## Initial Architecture Decisions (Pre-Development)

### DEC-001 — FastAPI over Express for Backend
- **Date:** Project start
- **Decision:** Use Python FastAPI instead of Node.js Express
- **Reason:** Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) is Python-native. Running ADK agents in Python avoids a language-boundary bridge. The team also has more Python familiarity from university coursework.
- **Rejected alternative:** Express.js with TypeScript — would require calling a Python subprocess for ADK, adding complexity.
- **Status:** Final

### DEC-002 — Llama 3.2 1B as the Universal On-Device SLM
- **Date:** Project start
- **Decision:** Use `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf` via `llama.rn` on all devices
- **Reason:** Gemini Nano requires Pixel 6+ with Android 14+ — this excludes the majority of phones in Pakistan. A single cross-platform model is simpler to maintain and test. 1B is sufficient for structured symptom collection with a tight system prompt.
- **Rejected alternatives:**
  - Gemini Nano: device fragmentation too high for disaster use case
  - Llama 3.2 3B: ~2GB file, needs 3GB+ active RAM, excludes older mid-range devices
  - Phi-3 Mini: 2.3GB, same problem
- **FYP Presentation note:** "We chose Llama 3.2 1B for universal device compatibility. Future work includes a purpose-built medical SLM fine-tuned for clinical intake."
- **Status:** Final

### DEC-003 — Gemini 2.0 Flash as Cloud LLM
- **Date:** Project start
- **Decision:** Use `gemini-2.0-flash` for both cloud-side conversation and SOAP generation
- **Reason:** Native Google ADK integration with zero extra configuration. Free tier provides 15 RPM and 1M tokens/day — sufficient for FYP demo load. No separate API key needed beyond the one Google account.
- **Rejected alternatives:**
  - GPT-4o Mini: paid only, no free tier
  - Groq Llama: good but adds another service dependency
- **Status:** Final

### DEC-004 — Protobuf for Mobile-to-Server Payload
- **Date:** Project start
- **Decision:** Use Protocol Buffers to serialize the triage payload sent from phone to server
- **Reason:** Disaster scenarios mean 2G/GPRS connectivity. JSON payloads for a triage case are ~3-5KB; protobuf binary is ~800 bytes for the same data. This is the difference between a payload succeeding or timing out on GPRS.
- **Rejected alternative:** JSON — readable but 4-6x larger
- **Status:** Final

---

### DEC-005 — Rule-Based Triage (Not LLM-Based)
- **Date:** Project start
- **Decision:** Triage classification (RED/AMBER/GREEN) is computed by a deterministic keyword + severity rule engine, not an LLM
- **Reason:** Safety-critical. An LLM can hallucinate or be unavailable. Triage must produce a result in < 200ms with zero network dependency. The LLM cloud audit is additive (it can escalate but not initiate triage) and only runs when online.
- **Status:** Final — this rule must never be changed
